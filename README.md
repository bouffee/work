<p>I work as a junior integration engineer in Greenatom. My main place of working is Apache Nifi - ETL-instrument for dataflow menagement. 
  So, mostly there are patterns and examples of XSLT-code, script codes that can be used in Nifi and templates for Nifi. Now I also prepare education plan for newbees in Nifi, for this project there is a folder: 
<a href="https://github.com/bouffee/work/tree/main/EducationalScripts">EducatinalScripts</a>. There are only example scripts that will be shown in plan.</p>
